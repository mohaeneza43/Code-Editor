This is a simple code editor web application with an integrated AI helper and a command output viewer. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Ace editor for code editing capabilities.

## Features

- **Code Editor**: A full-featured editor using the Ace library with syntax highlighting and autocompletion.
- **AI Helper**: A simulated AI helper that analyzes the code and provides suggestions for improvement.
- **Command Output Viewer**: Allows users to run JavaScript code directly from the editor and view the output or any error messages.

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. No additional setup is required.

## Note

- The AI helper is a basic simulation and does not perform advanced code analysis.
- The code execution is limited to JavaScript and runs in the browser environment.
